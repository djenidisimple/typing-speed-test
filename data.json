    "easy" : "In this Paper it will be with Human rather than with Simious Brains that I shall contrast and compare the Brain of the Orang Utang; incidentally, however, I shall institute comparisons between the Brain of the Asiatic Ape, and that of the smaller of the two most anthropoid African Apes, the Chimpanzee.",
    "medium" : "The modern Idealist may avoid his predecessors' anatomical errors; but, if he be true to his principles, he will feel no anxiety to repudiate their metaphysics. He may make his strong position yet stronger, we believe, by adducing biological evidence in disproof of the usually granted assumption, that mental capacity stands always in a certain relation to cerebral development; but holding, as he does, the existence of an essential difference between mind and matter, he makes himself but a materialist for the nonce, if he express any repugnance to such statements as those just quoted on account of any conclusions to which they could lead him. For even if they were wholly, as we believe they are nearly, true to the facts, he could draw from them, if he remained true to his principles, no other conclusions than did Buffon and Tyson.",
    "hard" : "The greater width of the semilunar segment exposed on the left side was, no doubt, owing to the gravitation of the cerebral lobes, but the greatest width of this segment was only three lines. The relations thus described are well shown in Pl. iii., fig. 3. The view of the base of the brain, as given in fig. 2, will enable us to complete our observations as to the relations of the cerebellum to the posterior lobes of the cerebrum. On looking at that figure, it will be seen that no cerebral surface comes into view on the outside of the lateral boundaries of the cerebellum. In a view of the base of the human brain, some cerebral substance is invariably seen in this situation; but the same is the case with a second orang's brain, with a chimpanzee's brain, and with the brains of several Cercopitheci, and an Inuus, in the Series belonging to the Christ Church Museum.The cerebellum does not project so far laterally as to cover the cerebral lobes in a basal view of any brain in Tiedemann's Icones which is above the rank of the Lemuridæ.",
