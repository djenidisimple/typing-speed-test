    "hard" : "The greater width of the semilunar segment exposed on the left side was, no doubt, owing to the gravitation of the cerebral lobes, but the greatest width of this segment was only three lines. The relations thus described are well shown in Pl. iii., fig. 3. The view of the base of the brain, as given in fig. 2, will enable us to complete our observations as to the relations of the cerebellum to the posterior lobes of the cerebrum.",
